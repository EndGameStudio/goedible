            <div class="content">
                <p>This community has a problem. The nearest grocery store is 4.4 miles away. It has a small produce section, and, unfortunately, for more eco-conscious people, minimal organic ingredients. It also has no local produce. The nearest Farmer’s Market is 13.9 miles away with limited hours and only seasonal availability. Most of the people in this 30 house neighborhood drive anywhere from 15-40 miles away to access their food and groceries. This consumes time, fuel, and money that this middle class neighborhood does not have in excess.</p>
<p>The neighborhood is also made up of predominately 1/2 acre and larger lots. About 1/3 of each lot is considered the front yard. Most of the yards contain seasonal grass and a small assortment of bushes and small trees. Those few who can afford the time and expenditure have actual green lawns, while the rest have a mixture of crabgrass, dandelion weeds, and sand-spurs. Overall, the neighborhood looks clean, but boring and tired.</p>
<p>To combat these two issues, one should look into a community project. It would involve the beautification of the neighborhood, be ecologically and financially sustainable, and improve the availability of healthy, local produce. Instead of spending precious time and money on yards that are perpetually tired and dated, the community should begin a collaborative edible yard enterprise.</p>
<p>According to a study published in the American Journal of Public Health, “Neighborhood aesthetics, social involvement, and community garden participation were significantly associated with fruit and vegetable intake. Community gardeners consumed fruits and vegetables 5.7 times per day, compared with home gardeners (4.6 times per day) and non-gardeners (3.9 times per day). Moreover, 56% of community gardeners met national recommendations to consume fruits and vegetables at least 5 times per day, compared with 37% of home gardeners and 25% of non-gardeners. Our study results shed light on neighborhood processes that affect food-related behaviors and provides insights about the potential of community gardens to affect these behaviors. The qualities intrinsic to community gardens make them a unique intervention that can narrow the divide between people and the places where food is grown and increase local opportunities to eat better.” (CITE 1) This study proves how bringing a community together in a gardening initiative improves aesthetics, and also promotes better fruit and vegetable consumption for those involved. It even shows that community gardening has greater benefits than stand alone home gardening. Furthermore, A study which interviewed many home and community gardeners also showed an increase in the variety of plants consumed. “The most significant impact of home food gardening on food security found was its ability to enhance the accessibility and nutritional value of the diets of the gardeners interviewed. Although affordability of food was not a key issue, having a garden allowed respondents a greater diversity of fresh and nutritious produce than they might purchase otherwise. This is an important benefit of food gardening for all households, regardless of income level.” (CITE 2)</p>
<p>Aside from the increased nutrition, bringing the community together to garden the front yards, would also serve as a neighborhood beautification project. There is already a significant amount of time spent on individual yard maintenance with mixed results. To spread our the work and skills more equitably, would improve the overall appearance of the neighborhood. This would help with property values and neighborhood appeal. The time commitment would not have to increase, but an accurate assessment of individual gardening skills and knowledge, along with a true estimation of time allotted to yard maintenance would need to be discussed. Then, as a group the talents and skill of all could be successfully incorporated in a shared project.</p>
<p>The cost of this endeavor will not exceed what is already spent on the average home owner’s front yard. Many yards have decorative bushes which require trimming and fertilization. That money could be re-appropriated into edible bushes, such as blueberries. Some front yards have annuals which must be reseeded or replanted every year. There are many equally decorative edible plants that would be more that adequate replacements. Fruit trees could be used instead of flowering trees. Fragrant herbs offer a variety of sizes, textures and colors, all great to grow and equally great to consume! This solution would replace decorative only plants with equally decorative and edible plants. The number of nurseries in the vicinity of this neighborhood would make locating and affording such replacements easy and cost effective. For example, a flowering dogwood tree costs $20.99 at a local big box hardware store. The same store also sells peach trees for $16.49-$18.49 depending on the variety. Both trees flower and grow well in the environment. One actually gives fresh produce, thus paying for itself after a few years of production.</p>
<p>The neighborhood is also home to many families with children. Often, concern raised by parents is getting children to eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Recent studies are beginning to show that early exposure to home grown produce makes children more likely to consume fruits and vegetables. In particular, Saint Louis University published a study that found, “Researchers interviewed about 1,600 parents of preschool-aged children who live in rural southeast Missouri. They found that preschool children who were almost always served homegrown fruits and vegetables were more than twice as likely to eat five servings a day than those who rarely or never ate homegrown produce…In addition, children who grow up eating fresh-from-the-garden produce also prefer the taste of fruits and vegetables to other foods, the parents told researchers.” (CITE4) Converting the front yard into an edible garden is not only a fantastic family project, it is also an excellent way to inspire those young tastebuds to eat more healthfully!</p>
<p>To those who are concerned about ease of growing food, there are numerous ways to grow edible and decorative plants in containers. Bookman states, “Vegetables (and flowers) grown in small containers have several advantages over traditional in-ground gardens. Small containers are portable, easily monitored and watered, and, when grouped, can be very attractive. Plants can be grown out-of-doors in locations…where traditional gardens are impractical.” (CITE 5) Large pots on wheeled stands, window boxes, hanging porch baskets are all very beautiful, practical and easy ways to grow simple foods. Also, starting small often gives one more confidence to branch out a bit bigger after some success.</p>
<p>As stated before, the nearest grocery store is 4.4 miles away and does not have a large variety of produce. Critics of an edible garden initiative might propose adding more stores and shopping venues, but since the neighborhood is rural, it is not feasible. Also, there is no guarantee that an ideal grocery store to meet the neighborhood’s needs would open nearby. Most people would still have to travel out of the area to source the foods they enjoy most.</p>
<p>Concerns about the aesthetic qualities of the project need not exist. The community would not be expected to dig up their yards to plant and maintain raised gardens. The overall look of the yards would remain. The existing planters and open areas would be accented with decorative plants that also happen to be edible. Lawns are costly to plant, grow, maintain and water. Often, they are overtaken by weeds and other invasive grasses prompting for extreme use of chemicals. Barring the time and resources to care for such a lawn, they often become unkempt. According to Palliser, “Eastern U.S. states consume 30% of the water supply to maintain lawns.” (CITE3) Using the same amount of water, time and energy to grow food would be a much better use of these resources.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the front yards of this neighborhood could use some “sprucing up”. The community would be much better served if they would team up and work together to grown edible plants and share the bounty. Average costs in time and money need not be affected, only reprioritized. Families can grow healthier together with more variety and willingness to eat fresh produce. Any concerns or critiques over ugliness of edible yards can easily be dispelled with comparisons of plants with edible yet equally beautiful counterparts. As Ivette Soler, author of The Edible Front Yard stated, “A front yard revolution is at our fingertips and on our doorsteps. Its time has come.” Let’s garden!</p>
