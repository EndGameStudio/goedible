Aside from the increased nutrition, bringing the community together to garden the front yards, would also serve as a neighborhood beautification project.  There is already a significant amount of time spent on individual yard maintenance with mixed results.

The cost of this endeavor will not exceed what is already spent on the average home ownerâ€™s front yard. For example, a flowering dogwood tree costs $20.99 at a local big box hardware store. The same store also sells peach trees for $16.49-$18.49 depending on the variety. Both trees flower and grow well in the environment. One actually gives fresh produce, thus paying for itself after a few years of production.

To those who are concerned about ease of growing food, there are numerous ways to grow edible and decorative plants in containers.
