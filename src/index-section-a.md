This community has a problem. The nearest grocery store is 4.4 miles away. It has a small produce section, and, unfortunately, for more eco-conscious people, minimal organic ingredients. It also has no local produce.

To combat these two issues, one should look into a community project. Instead of spending precious time and money on yards that are perpetually tired and dated, the community should begin a collaborative edible yard enterprise.
