                        <div class="section"><p>This community has a problem. The nearest grocery store is 4.4 miles away. It has a small produce section, and, unfortunately, for more eco-conscious people, minimal organic ingredients. It also has no local produce.</p>
<p>To combat these two issues, one should look into a community project. Instead of spending precious time and money on yards that are perpetually tired and dated, the community should begin a collaborative edible yard enterprise.</p>

                        <div class="section"><p>The neighborhood is made up of predominately 1/2 acre and larger lots. About 1/3 of each lot is considered the front yard. Most of the yards contain seasonal grass and a small assortment of bushes and small trees.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit and Vegetable Consumption:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Community gardeners consume <strong>5.7 times per day</strong></li>
<li>Home gardeners consume <strong>4.6 times per day</strong></li>
<li>non-gardeners consumes <strong>3.9 times per day</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s why you should do <a href="#section-c">this</a> instead!</p>

                        <h2 class="center">Do this!</h2>
                        <div class="section"><p>Aside from the increased nutrition, bringing the community together to garden the front yards, would also serve as a neighborhood beautification project.  There is already a significant amount of time spent on individual yard maintenance with mixed results.</p>
<p>The cost of this endeavor will not exceed what is already spent on the average home ownerâ€™s front yard. For example, a flowering dogwood tree costs $20.99 at a local big box hardware store. The same store also sells peach trees for $16.49-$18.49 depending on the variety. Both trees flower and grow well in the environment. One actually gives fresh produce, thus paying for itself after a few years of production.</p>
<p>To those who are concerned about ease of growing food, there are numerous ways to grow edible and decorative plants in containers.</p>
